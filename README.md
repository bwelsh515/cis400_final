# CIS 400 Final Project

`Hindsight Analysis Framework: March Madness as a Case Study`

## Authors

This project was created by Brian Welsh, Michael Hellman, Kai Bernstein, Carlos Leal, Wojciech Wojciechowski.

## Purpose

This project was created for our CIS 400 Data Mining class at Syracuse University. We wanted to use data mining to determine if users on Twitter are capable of predicting the outcome of special events. As an initial case study, we decided to use March Madness. You can find more information regarding this project in our presentation slides and report.

## Prerequisites

This project was created using Python 3.5. We also used the following libraries:

- [Twitter](https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html)
- [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org)
- [Textblob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)

You must install all of these using `pip3 install`. Then, simply run the script!
